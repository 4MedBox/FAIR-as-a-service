# FAIR-as-a-service

## Introduction
Many DCCs have operational expertise in deploying software services, but lack expertise in deploying and exploiting 
FAIR services that use Semantic Web technology for machine actionability. Although local deployment is lightweight and 
non-invasive for institutional infrastructure, engineers are not yet familiar with the underlying web technologies of 
FAIR services. This poses a risk for delivering the FAIR foundation of a federated health data infrastructure that is 
ready for federated analytics, AI, and machine learning. <br> FAIR as a service is making deployment by institutional 
DCCs of FAIR services cost-effective, scalable, and sustainable by delivering ‘FAIR as a Service’ (FaaS).

## Architecture
This repo consists of an Archimate architecture to visualize the concept of FAIR as a Service. This can be subject to 
changes while connecting new components.
